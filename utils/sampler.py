class MultiFoldDistributedSampler(Sampler):
    """Modified from DistributedSampler, which performs multi fold training for 
    accelerating distributed training with large batches.
    
    Sampler that restricts data loading to a subset of the dataset.

    It is especially useful in conjunction with
    :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`. In such case, each
    process can pass a DistributedSampler instance as a DataLoader sampler,
    and load a subset of the original dataset that is exclusive to it.

    .. note::
        Dataset is assumed to be of constant size.

    Arguments:
        dataset: Dataset used for sampling.
        num_replicas (optional): Number of processes participating in
            distributed training.
        rank (optional): Rank of the current process within num_replicas.
        shuffle (optional): If true (default), sampler will shuffle the indices

    .. warning::
        In distributed mode, calling the ``set_epoch`` method is needed to
        make shuffling work; each process will use the same random seed
        otherwise.

    Example::

        >>> sampler = DistributedSampler(dataset) if is_distributed else None
        >>> loader = DataLoader(dataset, shuffle=(sampler is None),
        ...                     sampler=sampler)
        >>> for epoch in range(start_epoch, n_epochs):
        ...     if is_distributed:
